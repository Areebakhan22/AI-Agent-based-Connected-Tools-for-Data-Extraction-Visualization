# Client Update - SysML to Slides Project

**Status:** Research & Development in Progress

## Update

We transitioned from Google Slides to PPTX generation for better control. The implementation is functional, but alignment and layout precision still need refinement. We are currently researching pre-trained models on Hugging Face to improve our layout algorithms.

**Deliverable:** Detailed progress report by end of day today.
